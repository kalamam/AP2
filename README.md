# AP2
Advanced Programing 2 - Moshe Kalamaro and Noam Kaplinski
To enter each exercise, you should go to his specific branch.
# ex4
To run our project please follow the following steps:
1. clone the ex4 branch
2. cd AP2
3. cd web-ap
4. dotnet run <br />
with this steps you will run the web api server. <br />
now, you will need to activate the android client. 
The android client is located in the android-client folder, instead of extracting all the files and dealing with the build and the hidden folders that cannot be uploaded to the git,
you can also extract the zip we gave you, after the extraction open the android studio application then press File in the top left corner, then press open project and open the right project from the extracted file.
you can see how in the following picture:

and the press ok.
Thats it!
The folder with the zip looks like this after you press extract here on the zip:

note:
we changed how to server is built and instead used cSharp because we didn't succeed to build to server like in ex3, and because it was not written which language you need to build with we decided to use cSharp because we both learned it and know it.


# Thank you for this semester we learned a lot!!!
