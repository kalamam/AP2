# AP2
Advanced Programing 2 - Moshe Kalamaro and Noam Kaplinski
To enter each exercise, you should go to his specific branch.

# part1:
in part1 we have the first part of the assignment, where you need to connect the react app to a given server named final.
to run our code, do this steps:
1. create a new react app.
2. download the files and change what the public and src directorys contain so it matches whats in the part1 directory.
3. start the server, was shown in the assignment itself. 
4. write npm start from the right directory (where you have the packege.json...)
now, it should open a new tab, in the adress http://localhost:3000.

the react app should look like the web-client app:

to start do: cd web-client and then do npm start.

# part2:
in part2 we have the second part of the assignment, where we need to build a server ourselfs.
to run our code, follow the steps:
1. use the code from part1 to create a new react app.
2. download the code from part 2 and insert it into a desired directory,
in the same directory use: npm i express bode-parser cors custom-env mongoose.
start the app with: node app.js (in the right directory)

# part3:
in part3 we have the third part of the assignment, where we implemented real time communication between usrers.
to run our code, follow the steps:
1. use the code from part1 (from within part3 directory) to create a new react app and in the same directory use: npm i socket.io-client.
2. download the code from part2 (from within part3 directory) and insert it into a desired directory, in the same directory use: npm i express bode-parser cors custom-env mongoose socket.io
start the client with: npm start (in the right directory)
start the app with: node app.js (in the right directory)
